My first attempt at a quick and responsive theme for use with CORE.
Uses a combination of logo/screenshot/fanart for the banners on the menu, transitioning to video on idle on game select.
Game select shows various metadata, current playlist and genre.
Thanks to the CORE Team, P1ch3 & wraith for their help and code snippets from their themes.
